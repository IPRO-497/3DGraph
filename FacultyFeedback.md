# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

- We should probably work on your problem statement a bit to make it a bit smoother
- Slides could use titles.  For example, the scenarios slides don't a title.
- Scenarios slides are very text heavy.  Could you provide a few bullets and actually "read" the entire text when you present it?
- What do the various models cost you to print and ship?  Will you actually make money?
- More conventional UI might be good.
- I like your sizing of work and prioritization
