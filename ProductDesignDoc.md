# Top Two Scenarios

## Scenario 1

Zain's back from a long jog. Sweaty, tired and exhausted. He plops on his bed and doesn't see himself doing this same insane workout tomorrow. But at the corner of his eyes there's a little masterpiece sitting on his drawer. A 3d representation of the miles he's treaded on every day of every week. That's his little motivation and that's what keeps him going.

## Scenario 2

Sufyan's been racking his head about this new data brought to him. He's a HR employee and a damn good one at that! With little training on data analysis this insane amount of data that spans the whole year s enough to give him a tough break. Luckily he's heard of a website that displays data intuitively and in a physical human way. With the 3d model as a reference he easily wraps his around the insane (365) amount of data and has more than enough time to explain to his HR colleagues.

## Scenario 3

Tomiwa spends an unhealthy amount of time on github, managing projects and contributing to cutting edge softwares. He feels really proud about this and would like to commemorate this achievement forever. In order achieve his dream we offer to fetch all his contributions from github and visualize them as an elegant 3D model which he can view at anytime! Not only can Tomiwa see this 3D model and commemorate his GitHub contributions forever, it turns out it's a great conversation starter and now his colleagues can't stop asking him how he got his!

## Scenario 4

Sufyan is a huge space fan and follows NASA all the time. We would like to replenish this love for
outer space by printing him a 3D rocket. We will fetch data from NASA website on the 
launchoff velocities (vx, vy, vz). NASA are great they already provide us with the 3D data, we will
use these velocities to find the direction of the rocket before it exits planet earth.
We create a 3D model of a rocket and place its tip to the relative direction that it exited earth.
Now Sufyan can 3D print the rocket with its tip in the direction it were to exit our beloved planet 
earth. Dream come true for Sufyan!
