# Top Four Scenarios

## Scenario 1

Zain's back from a long jog. Sweaty, tired and exhausted. He plops on his bed and doesn't see himself doing this same insane workout tomorrow. But at the corner of his eyes there's a little masterpiece sitting on his drawer. A 3d representation of the miles he's treaded on every day of every week. That's his little motivation and that's what keeps him going.

## Scenario 2

Tomiwa spends an unhealthy amount of time on github, managing projects and contributing to cutting edge softwares. He feels really proud about this and would like to commemorate this achievement forever. In order achieve his dream we offer to fetch all his contributions from github and visualize them as an elegant 3D model which he can view at anytime! Not only can Tomiwa see this 3D model and commemorate his GitHub contributions forever, it turns out it's a great conversation starter and now his colleagues can't stop asking him how he got his!

## Scenario 3

Sufyan's been racking his head about this new data brought to him. He's a HR employee and a damn good one at that! With little training on data analysis this insane amount of data that spans the whole years enough to give him a tough break. Luckily he's heard of a website that displays data intuitively and in a physical human way. With the 3d model as a reference he easily wraps his around the insane (365) amount of data and has more than enough time to explain to his HR colleagues.

## Scenario 4

Sufyan is a huge space fan and pulls all nighters for every spaceship launch. He's been preocupied with his new job and has less and less time to stargaze. While reminiscing he realized he might have to keep his hobby to the side and would love to immortalize his last launch. He came to our site and requested a live 3D model of the rocket at the peak of it's escape velocity. We fetched data from NASA's website on the launchoff velocities (vx, vy, vz). NASA's API was extremely helpful as it generously gave us the data needed which we used to place the 3D rocket model at the perfect angle captured in that beautiful moment where another spaceship left the pull of earth. Now Sufyan can reminisce on his childhood days and times when his biggest problems was how much caffeine was needed to keep a 13 year old boy awake through the night. Dream on Sufyan!

## Team Working Agreement (All team members)

We would like to develop a web application that can display given data in 3D format and displays a 3D model of it. This 3D Model can be downloaded and 3D printed by the user. 

### Tools
- We will use Github for version control. Team-members will push their finished code to a branch to ensure the main branch remains bug-free.
- If we need to meet outside of class we have found a mutually agreeable time at: Fridays past 5:00PM
- If we need to meet outside of class we will use the following tool/tech for meetings: Discord
- When we are not meeting together we will use the following tool/tech for communications: Discord

### Requested Approach/Behavior 
- We will communicate respectfully in a professional manner. Discussions only. No arguing/name calling of any kind. Respect the ideas of each team member.
- We will divide work fairly. Each member will be responsible for the work they choose to be assigned to (based on their skillset). Each member should be assigned to one or more stories on the Kanban board.
- Each member will work on their task until completed there will be no complete changing of tasks unless the entire groups approves the decision.
- Designate one member to follow the entire group to see where they are at and what obstacles they are facing.

### Unacceptable behavior
- Group members not finishing their tasks efficiently and in a timely manner.
- Group members not getting along
- Not respecting meeting times

### How will we productively solve disagreement
- Voting
- Make room for a little argument and allow each member to speak
- Understanding each other's point of view.
