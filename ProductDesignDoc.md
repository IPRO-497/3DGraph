# Problem Statement

**Visualizing contributions to a community and interacting with them in a physical form is challenging. Our solution offers both visualization and physical interaction with community Github contributions data.**

# Customer

- Web Users of - GitHub, LeetCode
- 3D Enthusiasts
- Collectors

## Description

Our Customers are professionals and students alike with a lot of work/achievement that are displayed poorly, giving them a very rough and complex understanding of what they have done.

## Other customer(s) or stakeholder(s)

Students, Hikers, Professors, Organizations, Writers, ...e.t.c.

# Application type (web app, mobile, website, native client, â€¦)

## Tech stack

### Client Tech

- React
- React THREE Fiber
- THREE.js
- Babel Loader
- Node.js(npm)
- Styled components

### Server Tech

- GraphQL
- REST API
- Node.js
- Express

# Top Application Capabilities

- Fetch different types of data on websites selected
- Transform data from 2D to 3D reducing the complexity
- Display 3D display of data fetched from the website
- 3D print the displayed 3D model
- Choose 3D model of choice

# Top Four Scenarios

## Scenario 1

Zain's back from a long jog. Sweaty, tired and exhausted. He plops on his bed and doesn't see himself doing this same insane workout tomorrow. But at the corner of his eyes there's a little masterpiece sitting on his drawer. A 3d representation of the miles he's treaded on every day of every week. That's his little motivation and that's what keeps him going.

## Scenario 2

Tomiwa spends an unhealthy amount of time on github, managing projects and contributing to cutting edge softwares. He feels really proud about this and would like to commemorate this achievement forever. In order achieve his dream we offer to fetch all his contributions from github and visualize them as an elegant 3D model which he can view at anytime! Not only can Tomiwa see this 3D model and commemorate his GitHub contributions forever, it turns out it's a great conversation starter and now his colleagues can't stop asking him how he got his!

## Team Working Agreement (All team members)

We would like to develop a web application that can display given data in 3D format and displays a 3D model of it. This 3D Model can be downloaded and 3D printed by the user. 

### Tools
- We will use Github for version control. Team-members will push their finished code to a branch to ensure the main branch remains bug-free.
- If we need to meet outside of class we have found a mutually agreeable time at: Fridays past 5:00PM
- If we need to meet outside of class we will use the following tool/tech for meetings: Discord
- When we are not meeting together we will use the following tool/tech for communications: Discord

### Requested Approach/Behavior 
- We will communicate respectfully in a professional manner. Discussions only. No arguing/name calling of any kind. Respect the ideas of each team member.
- We will divide work fairly. Each member will be responsible for the work they choose to be assigned to (based on their skillset). Each member should be assigned to one or more stories on the Kanban board.
- Each member will work on their task until completed there will be no complete changing of tasks unless the entire groups approves the decision.
- Designate one member to follow the entire group to see where they are at and what obstacles they are facing.

### Unacceptable behavior
- Group members not finishing their tasks efficiently and in a timely manner.
- Group members not getting along
- Not respecting meeting times

### How will we productively solve disagreement
- Voting
- Make room for a little argument and allow each member to speak
- Understanding each other's point of view.
