# Problem Statement

## What is the problem

Since the beginning of internet graphics, graphs have been the go to for data visualization and analysis. However with more complex data and more data parameters, graphs have become more and more complex and now require a sufficient skill level to visualize, understand and analyze.

## How do we approach this problem

Our solution is quite simple and intuitive - **add a new axis**! With the addition of a new axis the number of ways to visualize data increases by 50%! Our goal for this project is to crunch and break down as many as possible complex, critical data into a cute 3D model that is intuitive to anyone who knows the concept of "height".

We also plan on making this 3d model printable - great for a conversation starter, or a desk buddy. 

## What we are doing

Our project is divided into three sections.

1. Researching, Strucutring and performing data analysis on API data gotten from different endpoints.

2. Creating a 3D model of a 2 dimensional data.

3. Downloading and Printing 3D model.

## How we plan on achieving the tasks

1. Splitting our overwhelming work force into different groups based on their area of expertise.

2. Begin Research on potential data API endpoints.

3. Research 3D tips, optimization and shading techniques, designs and geometry modeling for 3D.

4. Figure out a way to print a 3D model.

## What resources and information do we currently have

1. An amazingly talented photographer and Photoshop editor expert.

2. An AI enthusiasts.

3. A 3d printer enthusiasits.

4. Willing members with a rough idea on tasks.

5. Basic knowledge on how to create 3d models and web pages.
