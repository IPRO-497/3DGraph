# Problem Statement

## What we are doing

Our project is divided into three sections.

1. Researching, Strucutring and performing data analysis on API data gotten from different endpoints.

2. Creating a 3D model of a 2 dimensional data.

3. Downloading and Printing 3D model.

## How we plan on achieving the tasks

1. Splitting our overwhelming work force into different groups based on their area of expertise.

2. Begin Research on potential data API endpoints.

3. Research 3D tips, optimization and shading techniques, designs and geometry modeling for 3D.

4. Figure out a way to print a 3D model.

## What resources and information do we currently have

1. An amazingly talented photographer and Photoshop editor expert.

2. An AI enthusiasts.

3. A 3d printer enthusiasits.

4. Willing members with a rough idea on tasks.

5. Basic knowledge on how to create 3d models and web pages.
